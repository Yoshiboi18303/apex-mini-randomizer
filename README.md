> That's completely fine, you can clone the branch you want from the repository on GitHub!
> Here's how to do it (instructions are from a `Windows 11` computer, some of the references might be different on earlier versions of `Windows`, `MacOS` or `Linux`):
>
> **1.** Go to the repository on GitHub, then go to either the `main` or `dev` branch.
>
> **2.** Click on the green **`Code`** button at the top right of the file view

> **3.** Click on the `Download ZIP` button, then wait for the ZIP to be downloaded.
>
> **4.** Locate the ZIP file, then `Right Click` on it and click `Extract All`.
>
> **5.** Enter the directory you would like the ZIP file to be extracted to, then click the `Extract` button.
>
> **6.** Wait for the ZIP file to be extracted, then you're ready to continue along!
>
> **7.** _(optional, do this if you want a cleaner directory)_ Head to the extracted directory, then head inside the single folder, then highlight all the children of said directory, and move them to the parent folder.
>
> **8.** _(only do this if you followed step 7)_ Remove the folder the children were originally.
